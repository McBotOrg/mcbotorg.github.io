## What is McBot?

McBot is a Minecraft Bot service in the cloud. You don't need to download or install anything, and you will be able to use your Minecraft account to AFK your farms or chat with friends with a browser. It is a piece of code simulating Minecraft client to communicate with public facing Minecraft servers.

## Does it work locally?

Since McBot is a cloud service, it may not be able to connect to your local Minecraft game. It works with public Minecraft servers by connecting to them through valid IPs or domains.

## Is it free?

It's free to start. Our basic AFK Bot is totally free to use. In the future, we will introduce more advanced Bots, and they may require some subscription.

## What Minecraft versions does McBot support?

Currently McBot only supports **Java Edition** Minecraft servers. The following versions are tested:
- 1.16.x, 1.15.x, 1.14.x, 1.13.x
- 1.8.x, 1.9.x, 1.10.x, 1.11.x, 1.12.x

## Do I need to provide my Minecraft account?

Yes, McBot requires a Minecraft account to run. Please check out [here](/update/password-optional/#why-password-is-needed-to-run-bot) for more details.
