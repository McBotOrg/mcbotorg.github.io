## Features

We have included all the fundamental functions into this version to make the whole Bot service "usable":
- User system: register / signin with email
- Bot sysstem: create / start / stop a Bot, view history
- Bot Interaction: online players, inventory, in-game variables, chat
- Support: help button
- Mobile experience: minimal mobile device support

## Next

We would focus on overall stability for the next release. Several user experience research would happen to drive our service improvements.
