This tutorial will show you how to AFK your Minecraft farms even without a computer or laptop.
You may think it is not possible. Well, it is possible when you are playing on a public server with only three steps,
suppose you are about to sleep:

## Step 1: Stand at your AFK spot

First, you will need to connect to your Minecraft server with your favorite Minecraft client, and walk your character
next to your farms, or make sure you are standing at the AFK spot like this:

## Step 2: Create a McBot online

McBot is a Minecraft Bot service in the cloud. You don't need to download or install anything.

Open your web browser and navigate to [https://www.mcbot.org](https://www.mcbot.org), click `Get Started` button or `Login/Sign Up` link.

Choose either `Sign in with email` or `Sign in with Facebook` to create an account if you don't have it already.

Click `+ Create Your First Bot` button, choose `AFK Bot` as the type, and click `Next`.

Name your Bot, such as "My AFK Bot", and fill in the Minecraft server address you are playing at, or IP address like this:

Click `Next`, and fill in your Minecraft account username and password. And finally click `Create` button.

## Step 3: Start your Bot

After a few seconds, you will enter onto your Bot page, and there is a blue `Start Bot` button. 

Click it, your Minecraft client on the computer should be kicked out because your Bot starts working now.

On the Bot page, you can use left side menu to see your in-game inventory, online players, messages, and more.
